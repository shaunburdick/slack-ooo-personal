This bot acts as you and will respond to DMs and Channel mentions with a message while you are away.

## Features
- Start time: Set a start and the bot will wait until set time before listening and responding
- End time: Set an end time and the bot will shut off on a set time
- Respond to IM/Multi-Person IM when someone directly messages you
- Respond to a channel where you are directly mentioned (@username)
- Respond to additional keywords (ex 'shaun, burdick')
- Reminder buffer: Bot will not respond to user/channel until a given time has elapsed (to prevent spamming)
- Auto Mark: Bot can mark all your messages as read
- The bot can be configured to announce out of office users to specific channels on specific times (you must be in that channel to make the announcement)

## Personal Slack Token
You can generate your personal Slack Token here: [https://api.slack.com/web](https://api.slack.com/web)

## Announcements
The bot can announce which users are out of office on a schedule. To enable this feature, you need to provide the bot with a list of channels to make the announcement and at what times (local to bot).
- **app.announce.channels**: this is an array of channel names to announce to
  - The bot *must* be a member of the channel in order to make the announcements
  - channels names *must* not contain the starting `#`
- **app.announce.times**: this is an array of times each day to make the announcement
  - Each time will be considered as 24-hour time, (ie `13:00` is 1:00 pm)
